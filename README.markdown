reddit_api
==========

This is a reddit API client, originally written for use by the mods of [`/r/houston`](http://reddit.com/r/houston). Inspired by James Cook's [`RubyRedditApi`](https://github.com/jamescook/RubyRedditAPI) (but with less documentation and no testing). Hopefully it will grow up soon.
